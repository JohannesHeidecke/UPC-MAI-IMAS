# Self-Interested Agents

These agents work independently to further their own interests, sometimes at the expense of others.

*Discrete MAS* have agents working independently with no relation or cooperation to one another. *MAS with emergent behaviour* have agents working independently that can sometimes cooperate without intentionally meaning to. 

## Application to our problem

The scout agents could reactively search for garbage. Their only goal is to find the garbage. This would be a suboptimal mechanism for the scout agents as it may lead to multiple scout agents searching in one place and leave areas of the map not searched.

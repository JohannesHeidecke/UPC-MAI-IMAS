# Part 1 â€“ Environment 



## Discussion: Role of the System Agent



## Accessible or Inaccessible / Fully or Partially Observable

Fully observable and accessible to the System Agent

Only partially observable and inaccessible to all the other agents

Therefore, globally, in general, accessible



## Deterministic, strategic or Non-deterministic

Strategic

The environment is deterministic, because its next state is perfectly predictable given knowledge of the previous state and the agent's action. 

Actions: detection (scout), harvesting (harvester), recycling (harvester)

The only unpredictable action is garbage popping up, which is determined by the System Agent. The environment, therefore, is strategic



## Episodic or Non-episodic



## Static or Dynamic



## Discrete or Continuous

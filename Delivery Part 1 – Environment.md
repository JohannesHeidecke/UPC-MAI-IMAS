# Part 1 â€“ Environment 



## Discussion: Role of the System Agent



## Accessible or Inaccessible / Fully or Partially Observable

Fully observable and accessible to the System Agent

Only partially observable and inaccessible to all the other agents

Therefore, globally, in general, **accessible**



## Deterministic, strategic or Non-deterministic

**Strategic**

The environment is deterministic, because its next state is perfectly predictable given knowledge of the previous state and the agent's action. 

Actions: detection (scout), harvesting (harvester), recycling (harvester)

The only unpredictable action is garbage popping up, which is determined by the System Agent. The environment, therefore, is strategic



## Episodic or Sequential (Non-episodic)

**Sequential**

Next action is dependent on previous



## Static or Dynamic

Dynamic

The System Agent adds new garbage to the map in a random and dynamic way

Doubts: Could the environment actually be static, because in between steps, while all the agents are deliberating (calculating, preparing the next step) nothing happens. Also, the environment does not change until an agent takes an action. There are no other processes operating on the environment other than the agents.



## Discrete or Continuous

**Discrete**

Limited number of actions
